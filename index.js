// Write your code here
// Create a variable called multiply set to an equation that will multiply the variables num1 and num2; the result of the multiplication should be 62.
let num1 = 31;
let num2 = 2;
let multiply = num1 * num2; // multiply is set to the result of num1 * num2, which is 62

// Create a variable called random that will generate a random integer greater than 0.
let random = Math.floor(Math.random() * Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER) + 1; // Generates a random integer greater than 0

// Create a variable called num3 and num4
let num3 = 64;
let num4 = 60;

// Create a variable called mod set to an equation that will calculate the remainder of dividing variable num3 by num4; the remainder should be 4.
let mod = num3 % num4; // mod is set to the remainder of num3 divided by num4, which is 4

// Create a variable called max that finds the highest number in a set; the value returned should be 20.
let numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20, 1];
let max = Math.max(...numbers); // max is set to the highest number in the set, which is 20
